This is the code in Renesas-RX23T, including the realization of all tasks.
RX23T is a 32-bit microcontroller which is appionted by competition. We changed the interfaces they provided such as serial and SPI.
All the files here should be compiled by e2studio. Notice that they cannot use C++ language in main function, you can use static library instead. "Mavcontrol.cpp" was one which was compiled to a static library.
